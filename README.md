## Project Overview

### Core Components

#### Importing Necessary Modules
The app uses Streamlit for the frontend and `pickle` for loading the pre-trained model.
```python
import streamlit as st
import pickle
```

#### Loading the Fashion Model
The pre-trained fashion recommendation model is loaded as follows:
```python
fashion_model = pickle.load(open('fashion_model.pkl', 'rb'))
```

#### Outfit Recommendation Function
The `recommend_outfit` function generates outfit suggestions based on user input for gender, body type, skin tone, and occasion.
```python
def recommend_outfit(gender, body_type, skin_tone, occasion):
    recommendations = fashion_model.get((gender, body_type, skin_tone, occasion), [])
    
    if not recommendations:
        return [{"name": "No recommendations available for this combination.", "image": None, "link": None}]
    
    return recommendations
```

### Streamlit User Interface
- **Input Options**: Dropdowns and selectors to input preferences.
- **Output Display**: Grid layout showcasing outfit recommendations with images and clickable links.

#### Example Layout
```python
st.title('ðŸ¤“ Wardrobe Wizard ðŸ‘—')
st.subheader('Magic for Every Occasion, See Yourself in Style!')
```

## Custom Styling
Custom CSS enhances the visual presentation of recommendations:
- **Clickable Images**: Product images link directly to the item page.
- **Consistent Design**: Uniform styling for text and links.
